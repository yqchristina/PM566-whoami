# Intro to Public Health Data Science

You need to make a fork of this repository, find your name in the list below, and replace it with something like:

```md
[**@username**](https://github.com/username/) something about you
```

For example, this is what I did with mine:

> [**@gvegayon**](https://github.com/gvegayon) My first programming language was Visual Basic and before going to business school I wanted to be a musician <img src="https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/893619?s=460&u=723af9d8b02e277a5a91e0c179bbdf4450abec4b&v=4" alt="An old picture of me" width="40px">

Notice the figure of my username (that's optional and fun). This is the code I used of writing that line:

```md

```

Look for your GitHub username and add a link to your Github profile and something about
yourself you don't mind sharing publicly. Remember to only modify the line with your
username! If you don't see your username, just add it at the end of the list (and see what happens!).

Once you are done, submit a
[Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) to include your information in the original
repository.
